Plans for sky duel game
--------------------------

most necessary features to make program work:
- 2 player
- only 4 buttons: up, down, shoot, special
- if plane goes out of screen then it is forced to come back

objects in this game:
-Menu - sets up everything, frames, panels, level, etc
-keyboard - stores all keys that are pressed for other classes to make decision
-level - displays background, holds and displays objects to the screen, stores scores
-plane - the plane, nothing more to say
-bullet - bullet that plane will shoot

test cases:
plane flies off to right - plane's direction is flipped so it comes back
bullets when touch the plane disapear and plane looses health

Plane class
-----------
things it knows
ImageBuffer im
double x, y;
double speed;
double direction
int xCenter, yCenter
int xGunBarrel, yGunBarrel;

things it does
update() //updating position

Level Class
-----------
things it knows
int updates per second
array of planes in game
array of bullets in game

start() //starts game, contains the game loop which call update and render per time
update() //redraws, calls all objects on the screen to update their position
render() //draws objects on the screen
checkForCollision() //checks if bullets collided with plane

Menu Class
----------
state
int updates
int height, width
Keyboard object
JFrame object


Things to test:
- test movements of the plane
- test that update() runs 60 times per second
- test collision with bullets
- test that plane returns if it exits the screen
