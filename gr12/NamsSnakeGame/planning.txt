pseudo code for findWay()

the findWay() will be used for seeing whether the mice are trapped by the cats long body. Using recursion the method will look at every possible way from the mouse's position and see whether it will be able to reach the edge of the board. If it can't due to the cat's body blocking the way, the mouse is set to be killed and player gets 2 points.

pre condition: boolean array of board with location of the cat marked true

boolean findWay(int x, in y)

	set the current position as visited

	if we are at the edge of the board return true

	try going up and findway() from the new position
	try goind down and findway() from the new position
	try going left and findway() from the new position
	try going right and findway() from the new position

	if no way is found return false
